I am a postdoctoral researcher working on using deep learning to improve in-situ defect detection in additive manufacturing in [Paul Hooper's group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/paul.hooper) at Imperial College London. Before my current position at Imperial College, I completed a PhD in Physics at the University of Cambridge, where I was supervised by Gareth Conduit. 

My research interests include materials informatics, alloy design, Bayesian machine learning, and deep learning for image processing.
