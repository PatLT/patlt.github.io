My current work is on applying ML to detect in-situ defect formation in metal additive manufacturing (AM). Whilst I am currently developing large deep learning models, my PhD project used Bayesian models trained on smaller datasets for use in materials design, giving me broad experience applying ML and data-driven analysis in science."

      "summary": "An element-agnostic set of descriptors is proposed to model superalloy properties with Gaussian process regression. Furthermore, we develop a correction method to deliver the best and most physical predictions for microchemistry in multi-phase alloys. The model's performance in predictions is confirmed for superalloy microchemistry, microstructure, and strength properties. When including new, unseen elements in the test data, the models still give good predictions; such extrapolations into new chemical-space would be impossible with component-based descriptors."

      "summary": "Gaussian process regression machine learning with a physically-informed kernel is used to model the phase compositions of nickel-base superalloys. The model delivers good predictions for laboratory and commercial superalloys (R^2=0.924 for phase fractions). For four benchmark SX-series alloys the methodology predicts the phase composition better than conventional CALPHAD. Furthermore, unlike CALPHAD Gaussian process regression quantifies the uncertainty in predictions, and can be retrained as new data becomes available."
